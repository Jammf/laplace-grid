In the OIM paper, the model is specified as an addition of each DO to the SO, 
then a multiplication of all such sums. BUT --- is it possible to get 
grid patterns the other way around, first mutiplying each DO by the SO, then 
adding all such products? See lines 99 and 100 in oscillatoryInterference.py.
